/**
 * One clear button in a search box, not two.
 *
 * ## What this spec exists to catch
 *
 * The Explorer and PRs boxes are `<input type="search">`, and both draw their
 * own themed clear button beside the field so it matches the rest of the rail.
 * Chromium draws one *too*: `::-webkit-search-cancel-button`, a blue X painted
 * into the input's user-agent shadow tree the moment a focused search field has
 * content. The result was two X's a few pixels apart, one of them a colour the
 * theme never chose.
 *
 * Nothing in the DOM says so. The native button is not an element the page can
 * see — `querySelectorAll` never returns it, `getComputedStyle(input, '::-…')`
 * answers about the input rather than the pseudo element, and happy-dom paints
 * nothing at all. The only way to ask whether it is on screen is to pierce the
 * user-agent shadow tree over CDP and measure the box, which is what this does:
 * suppressed, the node still exists and its box is 0×0.
 *
 * The fix is one rule in `global.css` rather than dropping `type="search"`,
 * which keeps the field's `searchbox` role and its native Escape-to-clear. So
 * the assertion is deliberately over *every* search box the page is showing —
 * the rule is global, and a second one added later inherits both the behaviour
 * and this guard.
 *
 * The Explorer's box, in a real window: the browser target draws no list panel
 * in round two (HIVE-211), so none of its boxes is on screen there.
