 * The swarm layer, in a real browser against production output.
 *
 * Unit tests prove the pools, the hook and the drawing's plumbing. They cannot
 * prove that the creature's canvas actually paints, that it is laid out rather
 * than collapsed to nothing, or that a flavour line actually reaches the stage —
 * all three are build-and-layout claims, and happy-dom has no canvas and
 * performs no layout.
 *
 * The app boots empty, which is exactly the state this whole change is about,
 * so every surface asserted here is on screen at load with no setup.
