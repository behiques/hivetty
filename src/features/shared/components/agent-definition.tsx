 * One agent's `AGENT.md`, on the agent page's Definition view (HIVE-204) and

 *
 * What Settings › Agents did for the agent it had open, moved here when the
 * editor left Settings: the read on open, the name check, save, rename, delete,
 * and the shipped strip and held banner. Three things changed on the way:
 *
 * 1. **The buffer lives in editor-store**, keyed by name (`''` for the new
 *    agent), so leaving the page — another agent, another place — loses
 *    nothing and asks nothing. Revert is the only discard, which is why the
 *    discard guard Settings carried is gone.
 * 2. **Run now is the page header's**, in both views, so this component only
 *    draws the notice it is handed.
 * 3. **Delete hands back to the caller** (`onClose`): the page closes, Settings
 *    empties its detail pane.
 *
 * The rules each step keeps are the ones `agents-section.tsx` spelled out:
 * refusals are structured (`AgentWriteResult` names a field per problem), and a
 * rename is one call carrying the buffer, so the definition validated is the
 * one about to be written.
