 * ## Side by side on the page, tabs in Settings
 *
 * Settings' editor column is roughly 450–650px after the list, and a split
 * there lands each half near 300px, where `slack.channel:#incorp-dev` wraps, so
 * Settings asks for `layout="tabs"`. The page gives it the whole stage, so at
 * 900px of container and up the form and the source sit side by side and you
 * can watch the frontmatter change as you edit the form. The seam between them
 * drags, the split is kept in appearance-store, and neither pane goes below
 * its minimum width. Below 900px of a split the Form | Source tabs come back,
 * each with the full height.
 *
 * ## Why the real editor, and not a `<textarea>`
 *
 * This used to be a plain textarea, on the argument `skill-editor.tsx` then
 * made — that the editor seam exists for repo files, and mounting it here would
 * pull the explorer's stack into settings so the user can write a paragraph.
 * That argument undersold what an AGENT.md is, and the skills pane has since
 * abandoned it too. It is not a paragraph: it is a
 * frontmatter block with a dozen keys whose problems the footer reports **by
 * line**, and a body long enough to scroll — so a reader told "unknown key on
 * line 7" had to count rows with a finger, and could not search the file at
 * all.
 *
 * `EditorSurface` answers all three at once — the gutter, the floating find
 * panel, and `Mod-s` bound *inside* the view, which is the only place a save
 * shortcut can be bound and still fire while CodeMirror holds focus. Markdown
 * highlighting comes with it, so the `---` fences and the keys between them
 * stop reading as prose. The cost is one CodeMirror mount on the page, which is
 * lazy-chunked like every other.
