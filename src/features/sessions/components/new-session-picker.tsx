 * The new-session picker (story 044).
 *
 * ## Why the Radix primitive rather than `components/ui/dialog`
 *
 * The vendored `DialogContent` always portals to `document.body` and centres a
 * fixed-position card. This picker fills the **center stage** — the panels and
 * session header stay visible, exactly as the concept shows — so it is composed from
 * the primitive directly and rendered in place.
 *
 * What the story actually asks for is Radix's *behaviour*, and what is kept is
 * Escape, the dialog role, and the managed open/close lifecycle — all of which
 * live in `Content`.
 *
 * Not kept: scroll locking. Radix implements that in `Dialog.Overlay`, which
 * this picker deliberately omits — an overlay would paint a scrim across the
 * whole app and destroy the full-stage look the concept specifies. Nothing is
 * lost: the shell is a fixed-height, non-scrolling layout, so there is no page
 * scroll to lock.
 *
 * Also not kept, and this one was a bug rather than a choice: the focus trap
 * and the `aria-modal` semantics that hide the rest of the tree. Both come
 * from modality, and modality is wrong for a surface that leaves the header
 * and rails visible — it made them inert while they still looked live. See the
 * note on `modal` below.
