/**
 * Start a session in this project, from the tree, without the picker.
 *
 * The header's "New session" button opens the picker so the user can choose a
 * project; here the project is already named by the row above, so the picker
 * would only ask a question the click already answered. This spawns straight
 * away on the current defaults.
 *
 * ## An icon on the project's own line
 *
 * A `+` that shows on hovering the project row, beside the terminal glyph —
 * no visible text, so the `aria-label` carries the whole name and names the
 * project too, for a screen-reader user who arrives without the row.
 *
 * Playwright matches accessible names as a case-insensitive substring, so
 * `New session` finds the header button and every link here. The fix belongs
 * in the queries, and `tests/e2e/electron/` passes `exact: true` where it
 * means the header.
 *
 * ## Why the disabled state carries no extra guard
 *
 * `new-session-picker.tsx` re-checks `can.spawnSessionIn` before spawning
 * because its search box spawns on Enter, which never touches a disabled
 * button. This link has one path in, and `disabled` closes it — a second check
 * here would be a branch nothing can reach.
