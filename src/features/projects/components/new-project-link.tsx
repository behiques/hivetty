 * `cta` is the empty state's button, where there is no list to compete with and
 * the only thing on screen worth pressing should look pressable.
 *
 * The border is where `cta` stops. A fill would make the loudest thing in a
 * 320px rail an apology for an empty list, which is the one thing
 * `EmptyState` says a rail must not do.

/**
 * Map another repository, from the rail, without a detour through Settings.
 *
 * It opens the OS directory chooser, which *is* the question — there is no
 * app-side form to fill in, because a project is a folder.
 *
 * ## Why the head, and why the empty state
 *
 * The panel head used to carry a `+` for New session and a `new project` line
 * sat at the foot of the tree, which read as two buttons for one act. The
 * head's `+` is now this control, and the foot line is gone: a list whose only
 * affordance is at the bottom hides it the moment the fleet is longer than the
 * rail. New session stays one click away on each project's own line and in
 * the picker.
 *
 * With no tree there is no head, so the empty state renders this as
 * `EmptyState`'s `control` instead: sprite, flavour line, button, then the one
 * thing the rail cannot do.
 *
 * ## The accessible name
 *
 * `cta` shows the words `new project`; `icon` shows only the plus, so its
 * `aria-label` carries the whole name. Both say "Add a new project", which
 * contains the visible words (WCAG's Label in Name) and deliberately does not
 * contain "new session", so the substring locators that already have to
 * disambiguate that name are left alone.
