/**
 * An agent's Activity, under the agent page's header (HIVE-116; the header
 * moved to `agent-page.tsx` in HIVE-204).
 *
 * **Deliberately not a terminal.** Nothing here is typed into a process: the
 * input posts to the ledger, and the log is a transcript of turns that have
 * already ended. It keeps the terminal's rhythm — a header, a body, one input
 * at the bottom — so the eye knows where to look, and that is the whole of the
 * resemblance. Until this story an agent tab mounted a read-only xterm and a
 * message row, which looked like somewhere to type and was not.
 *
 * ## The frame: chrome full-bleed, content inset
 *
 * Three bands, and the session view's exactly — a header bar that spans the
 * stage, a padded body, and a prompt row that spans it again. This view used to
 * have none of that: it mounted straight into the stage with `gap-2` and no
 * padding at all, so the header, the fact tiles and the ledger all sat flush
 * against both edges and the prompt floated as a rounded box in the middle of
 * nothing.
 *
 * The rule the three bands express is that *chrome* touches the edges and
 * *content* never does. The body carries the only inset, and it is `px-4`
 * because the session header is — the two views are a tab apart and a gutter that
 * changed as you switched between them would read as the stage moving. The
 * prompt keeps the console's own `px-[18px]` for the same reason, from the
 * other direction: it is the same control, so it is the same row.
 *
 * ## The split
 *
 * Run log and ledger sit side by side rather than stacked, because the two
 * want different widths for reasons that do not move: the log renders at the
 * *terminal* type scale, which the user sets anywhere from 10px to 18px, so
 * its character budget is elastic; the ledger is chrome at a fixed size
 * showing short correspondence. The elastic one takes the remainder.
 *
 * `minmax(0, 1fr)` and not a bare `1fr`: `1fr` carries an `auto` minimum, so
 * one unbreakable 95-character tool line — `ARG_LIMIT` is 60, plus the tool's
 * name — would push the grid past the stage and hand the whole app a
 * horizontal scrollbar.
 *
 * The stack point is a **container query**, not a media query, and this is the
 * first one in the codebase. The rails drag from their floors (320px and 316px)
 * up to 520px each, so a 1920px window can hold a 700px stage; only this box
 * knows how wide it actually is. Below 720px the ledger drops beneath the log
 * at full width, which is the layout this story started from — nothing is
 * lost, it is just not the shape that suits a wide stage.
 *
 * 720, not the 800 it opened at. The default window is 1440px and the rails at
 * their defaults now take 636 of it, which leaves the stage 804px — four
 * pixels from the old stack point, so a 5px drag or a display a shade under
 * 1440 logical pixels flipped the layout. At 720 the log beside a 280px ledger
 * still has 432px, about 34 characters at the largest terminal size, which is
 * the narrowest a run line reads at all. `agents.spec.ts` narrows the window
 * to 1100px to cross it, where the stage is 464px.
