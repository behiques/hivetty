 * four literals meant either dropping information or lying about it.

 * and the colour comes from the category**, so the app shows what Jira shows and
 * no mapping table has to be maintained as workflows change.

    It existed until the link became real, and it could not have survived it:
    `hydrateTickets` replaces this whole list on every WORK-panel open, so a
    list of session ids stored on the ticket would be wiped by the next
    refresh. The key lives on the *session* instead — `Session.ticket` — and
    the reverse direction is `useTicketSessions(key)`, a selector over the
    entities map. Derived, never stored, exactly one source of truth.

    has no member to document and would attach itself to `url` below.
