 * ## Why pointer events on `window`
 *
 * A drag that listens on the handle itself stops tracking the moment the
 * pointer outruns it — which, on a fast drag, is immediately. Listening on
 * `window` for the duration of the gesture is what makes the divider follow the
 * cursor rather than being escaped by it. `setPointerCapture` is the other
 * answer and needs the element to survive the gesture; a re-render that
 * replaces the node mid-drag silently drops the capture, and this node
 * re-renders on every value change by construction.
 *
 * ## Why it is a `slider` with a `tabIndex`
 *
 * A split a mouse can move and a keyboard cannot is a setting only some users
 * have. `role="slider"` with `aria-valuenow` is the ARIA pattern for exactly
 * this, and the arrow keys make it real.
 *
 * The hit area is deliberately larger than the visible line: a 1px target is
 * unhittable, so the element is 5px of transparent padding around a hairline
 * that only shows on hover.

      Two rejected alternatives, because the choice looks arbitrary otherwise:

      - **A `<div role="separator" tabIndex={0}>`.** ARIA's *focusable*
        separator is arguably the most precise role for a split, but a div with
        handlers is a non-interactive element pretending to be one — it needs
        its own focus styling and key handling to behave, and `jsx-a11y`
        rejects it for exactly that reason.
      - **A `<button role="separator">`.** ARIA treats a focusable separator as
        interactive; the linter's role table does not, so this trades one error
        for another and buys nothing.

      `slider` is what this control actually is: a focusable thing whose arrow
      keys move a bounded value, which is precisely what `aria-valuenow`,
      `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax` below describe. It announces
