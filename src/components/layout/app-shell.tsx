/**
 * The command-center frame (HIVE-195): the activity bar, one list panel, the
 * stage and the session panel, in a single row under the macOS drag strip.
 * Nothing here scrolls; each region owns its scrollbar.
 *
 * Two `min-*: 0` overrides carry the whole layout:
 *
 * - `min-h-0` on the row, because a flex item's default `min-height: auto`
 *   refuses to shrink below its content and would push the panels past the
 *   viewport instead of scrolling them.
 * - `min-w-0` on the center stage, for the same reason on the inline axis. Skip
 *   it and a long unbroken terminal line widens the column, which xterm's fit
 *   addon then measures and grows into — the classic flexbox overflow trap the
 *   story calls out.
