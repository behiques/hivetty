 * ```
 *
 * Renders nothing unless the active tab *is* a session: the orchestrator has no
 * model of its own, and agents are long-lived workers rather than a metered
 * conversation. Returning null rather than an empty element lets the header's
 * row close the gap instead of holding a blank slot.
 *
 * ## It is a readout, not a chip
 *
 * The name is historical and the pill is gone. This is bare mono text now, cut
 * to the same size and colour as the fleet counts at the other end of the bar,
 * because the two report the same kind of thing and only one of them was ever
 * dressed as an object. See the class list on the root span for the argument.
 *
 * ## Three stats, not two
 *
 * The chip used to show context and a single unlabelled percentage that was, in
 * fact, the five-hour window — with a reset **time but no day**. Two of those
 * three facts were unrecoverable from the chip itself. Now each window carries
 * its own gauge and its own reset, and the weekly one carries the weekday,
 * because "resets 5p" is the same string on a Monday and a Friday and completely
 * different news.
 *
 * ## What it does when it does not know: nothing at all
 *
 * A stat with no number is **not rendered**. This replaced an em dash beside a
 * dimmed, empty ring, which was the right instinct — never invent a zero — and
 * the wrong shape: three placeholders is what the chip looks like in the first
 * seconds of *every* session, and each one is a labelled slot promising a number
 * that may never come.
 *
 * The waits are real and they are not all short:
 *
 * - `rate_limits` is absent until a session's first API response — seconds — and
 *   absent for the whole life of a session authenticated with an API key rather
 *   than a subscription.
 * - `context_window.used_percentage` is `null` until the session's **first
 *   assistant turn**, which is however long the user takes to send a prompt.
 *   Confirmed against Claude Code 2.1.228: a spawned session reports its rate
 *   limits on a timer while the context percentage stays null the entire time,
 *   because the number is computed from the last message carrying a `usage`
 *   block and an idle session has none.
 *
 * So an empty slot beside `ctx` was, in the common case, telling the truth about
 * a number the session simply has not produced yet. Absence says the same thing
 * without holding the space, and the stat appears — with its separator — on the
 * tick that first carries it. The chip grows rather than filling in, which is
 * the honest direction: the header only ever claims what it has been told.
 *
 * ### The percentage is what makes a stat, and a reset alone is not one
 *
 * Each window is gated on its **percentage**, so a payload carrying
 * `resets_at` with no `used_percentage` renders nothing rather than a lone
 * reset time. That is a deliberate trade and it does discard a reported fact.
 *
 * `↻ 2:30p` with no number beside it answers a question nobody asked: a reset
 * time is only actionable as the deadline on a quantity, and on its own it
 * reads as a countdown to something unstated. The old chip showed `— ↻ 2:30p`,
 * which kept the fact by reintroducing the placeholder this section exists to
 * remove.
 *
 * It is also not a state Claude Code produces: the two are emitted from one
 * object literal per window, so a reset without its percentage would mean the
 * payload shape had changed. The contract makes them independently optional and
 * `metrics.ts` reads them independently, which is why the case is handled at
 * all rather than assumed away — the tooltip drops it too, so nothing on screen
 * half-reports a window.
 *
 * ## Width, and what gives way
 *
 * The chip sizes to its content. The session header is a size container and
 * gives way in order as the stage narrows (HIVE-213, HIVE-220; widths are the
 * header's):
 *
 * 1. the title truncates;
 * 2. ≤ 880px, the resets give way to `5h` / `wk` (both spans render; the
 *    container picks one);
 * 3. ≤ 700px, the label shortens to the model name, window and effort left to
 *    the tooltip, as the status word hides;
 * 4. ≤ 620px, the detail words go: each stat is its ring and percentage;
 * 5. ≤ 560px, the label goes: the brain icon alone;
 * 6. ≤ 500px, the title column's floor drops from 140px to 110px.
 *
 * The three percentages never go. The full string, model, window, effort and
 * both resets included, stays in `title` at every step. The header's model slot
 * clips at its end only if these steps ever miss, so the menu stays reachable.
 *
 * The separators are hairline borders rather than `│` glyphs so they do not
 * change width with the font.
